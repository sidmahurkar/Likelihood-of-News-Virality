# Likelihood-of-News-Virality

Due to time constraint of only two days. I was able to complete Random Forest Classifier and Regressor.
For Classification we set a limit on the shares value and assign 0 and 1 as classes to the values of shares which are less than or greater than respectively. and try to solve as a binary classification problem.

For Regression we direcly try to predict the value of the values of share a particular news article will get.

We can try XGBoost and Neural network approaches to further achieve better results.
